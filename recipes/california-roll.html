    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> The California Roll is a popular sushi roll known for 
        its fresh, mild flavor and beginner-friendly ingredients. 
        It typically features imitation crab meat (or real crab),
        creamy avocado, and crisp cucumber, all wrapped in seasoned 
        rice and a sheet of nori (seaweed). Often rolled inside-out 
        with the rice on the outside and sprinkled with sesame seeds
        or tobiko (fish roe), this roll offers a perfect balance of
        textures and flavors. It’s a great introduction to sushi for
        those new to it, and a favorite choice for casual sushi 
        lovers everywhere.</p>
